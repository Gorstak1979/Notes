My dad has a small nose and green eyes, but from pictures I have when I was a toddler, he has a big nose like me and blue eyes.
My dad thinks my aunt lived on 2nd floor of her house in the island of Vir, where we were at numerous times visiting.
Fact is, 2nd floor is unfinsihed and aunt always lived on 1st floor.
