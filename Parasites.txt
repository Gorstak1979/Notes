It seems some kind of parasites that attack human mind exist. I got one when I was just a toddler, 40y ago, dunno how, and I think I have a new one now or more of them.
I witnessed a girl say in valorant discord she is handicapped, and someone told her he can help her, so the parasites may not necessarily be all that evil.
I have no idea who or what they are, but they seem able to speak to humans in digital world, online, and they seem to cause what's diagnosed as bipolarity.
I beleive croatian tennis player, Goran Ivanišević also had or still has one, judging on his behaviour. But even if they do help us, they resemble demons.
Who normally wants a parasite in his mind? Not much info I have that I can prove, since they are like ether, but I do beleive I got infected near the crack
in the asphalt on Zadar parking lot on Branimir coast, near the sea. They are sentient, and they seem to share what knowledge they learn between each other.
They also seem to change their host eye color to green, and increase their skull size when they reproduce.
